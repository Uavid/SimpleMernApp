👉 How to Build & Deploy (Very Simple Steps)

Step 1 — Start Minikube
minikube start --driver=docker

Step 2 — Enable Ingress
minikube addons enable ingress

Step 3 — Build Docker Images Inside Minikube
eval $(minikube docker-env)

docker build -t backend-image:1.0 ./backend
docker build -t frontend-image:1.0 ./frontend

Step 4 — Apply All Kubernetes Files
kubectl apply -f k8s/

Step 5 — Get Minikube IP
minikube ip


Example output:

192.168.49.2

🚀 Now open the app:

👉 http://192.168.49.2

It will show:

Frontend Running ✔
Backend says: Hello from Backend 🚀








✅ 1. Delete All Kubernetes Resources

Run this to remove everything in Minikube’s Kubernetes cluster:

Delete all deployments
kubectl delete deployment --all

Delete all services (except Kubernetes default service)
kubectl delete svc --all

Delete all pods
kubectl delete pod --all

Delete ingress
kubectl delete ingress --all

Delete configmaps & secrets
kubectl delete configmap --all
kubectl delete secret --all

✅ 2. Delete All Docker Images Inside Minikube

Switch docker to Minikube:

eval $(minikube docker-env)


Then list and delete all images:

docker images
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)

✅ 3. Completely Reset Minikube (FULL CLEAN-UP)
Stop Minikube
minikube stop

Delete Minikube cluster
minikube delete --all --purge

🔥 (Optional but Recommended) Restart Minikube Clean
minikube start

🔧 Now re-enable ingress (since it resets after delete)
minikube addons enable ingress

💡 After Reset, it will be fresh like new.

Now Jenkins can:

Build fresh docker images

Apply fresh deployments

No old pods/containers

No old services

No old ingress


✔ To delete ALL of them safely: delete the Minikube cluster.

You cannot remove those images while Minikube is running because Kubernetes core components are using them.

✅ Fix: Completely Wipe Minikube (Safe & Clean)
1. Stop Minikube
minikube stop

2. Delete the cluster
minikube delete --purge --all


This will remove:

✔ All containers
✔ All images
✔ All volumes
✔ All pods
✔ All K8s system components

🔥 Now switch Docker back to your HOST (important)

After deleting minikube, run:

eval $(minikube docker-env -u)


This resets Docker back to the host machine.

🧹 Now delete all remaining local Docker images

(You will now be deleting images from your host, not from Minikube’s internal env)

docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq)


This time no image is locked, so everything will get deleted.

🚀 Recreate Minikube fresh
minikube start


Enable ingress again:

minikube addons enable ingress


Now your Minikube environment is completely fresh and ready for Jenkins deployment.
